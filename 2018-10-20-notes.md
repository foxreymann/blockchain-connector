# TOMASZ

# genesis block

# block

anchors are used to alert the network for faster block times

# keccak (ketchak)

base for hash

eth was implemented before sha3, so eth uses keccak which is almost like sha3

# RLPx handshake (broken)

wikipedia diffie hellman key exchange

this is not secure but this is not the most critial for security

# p2p status: subprotocols

# eth62, eth63

eth62: full sync
  blocked downloads, verify everything
eth63: fast sync
  don't verify, download more with stats from 2015 w/o verifying

in bitcoin you verfiy from some snapshop, in eth you verfiy from the beggining

# ethereum vs ethereum classic

blocks:
0000000 frontier
1150000 Homestead
1920000 DAO change due to a bug, hardfork
2463000 Tangerine Whistle
2675000 Spurious Dragon
4370000 Byzantium
6500000 now

if someone attacks you can decide to fix and hardfork

etheremum classic is 500k block behind but is still supported

before DAO is was simple to attack network and cause lots of gas costs. examples: account creation

# private key

32 bytes (random, almost all valid)

# public key

64 bytes (or 65 bytes with 0x04)

in eth you don't share with people, you calculate hash (keccak) and share last 20 bytes

# secp256k1

Nethermind.Secp256k1.Test

# address

20 bytes

starts with ERC

# ERC

implementing new ERC often means changing the network to become a standard

# account

address -> nonce : balance : code hash : storage root

# signing

public void Sign(PrivateKey privateKey, Transaction transaction, SigInterger blockNumber)
{
}

# recovery

# RLP

is a binary serialization format for ethereum

# mining

cost of mining a block should be less than what you get for it

ATM you get $600, but only one miner wins

# NICK

ENS names contracts and accounts but also:

# What is END?

eth
  inigomontoya

# nodejs

npm ENS

# TOMASZ

# bloom filter

you check logs of each transaction

|| operation

if bit is not set you don't need to look for a log of the transaction

you can check each transaction like this and then you check the ones that you're not interested in

it is likely that each transaction is realted to a contract

# push something to memory and return it

send to memory, add 0 and 0

MLOAD takes 32 bytes from memory
MSTORE stores and takes 1 byte

# task

deploy a contract that adds two zeros
in init call store to memory
then return in an opcode
load something to memory, load it, deploy it

100 96 0 96 0 1 96 0 82 96 5 96 27 96 0 243

100 - push 5 bytes
96 push
0
96
0
1 MSTORE but it is still 0 in the memory as stack will show after next operation

2 more pushed before we can return

# call code as the base

don't use CALL, use CALLCODE and DELEGATECALL

fix between CALLCODE and CODE

DELEGATECALL - doesn't transfer any money so uses less items on the stack

as you can call as a library, as other contract, even as static contract if doesn't change anything

# task

put the 7 items on the stack, call this code and then deploy

use STATICCALL

# pruning

even in historical state we don't store every single transaction

block:
prevhash
state root
tx root
receipt root
