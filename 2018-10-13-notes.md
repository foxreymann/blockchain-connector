blockchain is secure in a way that we can verify everything

Application Perspective: Consisten View to all parties

Peer to Peer electorninc cash (solution for double spending problem)

Inst,..... smart contracts

# Security Perspective

"A $50 milion hack just showed that the DAO was all too human"

# What is my identity

private key

Private key: d
Public Key P = dG
An Account = A = Hash(P)

All users compute an identity locally on theri machine

Users can have one or more identities A1,A2

Sudo-anonymous

# What can I do with my identity

Digitally sign transation to authorise actions on the network

Transactipn: Sender & Signature, Receiver, Value ($$), Transaction Fee, Payload (data)

# How do I tell the world about my transactions?

Afterwards - he published it to the network

All peers verify and propagate it

# Consensus by competion: Puzzle solving

I'm a miner, I listen to transaction on the network, I create a block, but it is not valid first, I need to solve the puzzle, I solve the puzzle first, my block hits the blockchain

puzzle has a difficltuy, but there is many solutions to a puzzle

# solve the puzzle

walthy puzzle solvers are rewarded in-band tokens

key points: all nodes validate block according to a set of consensus rules

# validating

in bitcoin there is a list of valid coins, little script has a spending condition

bitcoind has a very simple puzzle, if it starts with certain amount of 0s it is solved

# conensus by competition: a wild fork appears

what happens when 2 people solve the block at the same time - blockchain

block 1 - block 2 ---- block 3a - block 4 - block 5
                   |-- block 3b

you have a fork, next transations will generate longer block and that one wins

what happens on Etherum?

anchor block, you follow the heaviest block

key point:
eventual consistency
Must wait until a transaction is confirmed

the heaviest - the one with most zeros

# Putting the pieces togehter

We have a network that can earch consensus on the order of transations. It looks a bit like a 'world computer'

# A trusted third party with public state

Hey, I'm a smart contract

I promise you the following:
1. I will never modify or change your code
2. I will always run the code you tel me too
.....

# Etherum: Gez Metric

I have a program. How do I measure the cost? Storage and computation

All computation storage is assocaited with a FIXED gas cost

Additions is 3 gas. Let;s pretend we do 100 additions:

3 8 100 = 300 gas

Base cost for the transaction

21000 gas

Altogheter we reqire 21300 gas

Fixed consensus, everybody agrees on a fixed cost of computation

The 'gas price' allows the user to set a competetive fee

# Contract

Creation Transation:
From: alice

# VOTING ON ETH

Send encrypted vote

Voters g(x1y1)g(v1),ZKP(v1) -> ElGamal EncryptedVote

Compute the tally!

Finally, ethereum (and votes) compute the product of the votes to reveal the tally:

pi(i)g(xiyi) = g(Eixiy1i)g(Eivi) = g(Eivi) = yes votes

Question: how expensive is it to run it on Eth back in 2016?

# bitcoin mining

blockhash is the puzzle

bitcoin block header:
previous block hash
timestamp
merkle tree root
.....

ethereum:
has more complicated proof of work
has receipt after event

ethereum block header:

# unlocked: Simplied payment verrifiaction model

like paying via mobile I don't to store all blockchain, just 80 bytes headers of all bitcoins
I don't verify block by myself. I believe that longest chain is valid.

# fraud proof

Proof that block is invalid

# cryptography;s goal is not always data privacy. In cryptocurrenice .. cryptography is used to guarantree it's integrity and to auth users

# THE MYTH OF DECENTRALISATION

Users of the network
Nakamoto Consensus
Public Verifialbity

Security Paradigm: Trust, but verify

Users of network - decentralised
Public verifiability - centralised

Big block - 1MB

# Tradegy of commons

Tradegy of the commons - shared resource - in long term makes sense to maintain. But in short term someone can make more monies by not maintaining shared resource - for example jump to mine different cryptocurrency

Example: Every block gives you 1ETH.

# Top miners

Increasing power 0-51%

Delay of Censor Transactions
Any protocols that require an action to be performed with a 'grace period'

Withhold Blocks
Using block hash as a random beacon (eg. gamblocg). Miner can biat te beacon.

Impact exectution of ordering transactions
Their transaction is the first one processed in the block

51% of miners can blacklist the 49%

You have to wait 6 blocks to be sure block won't get discarded.

# Coinbase transaction is a transaction inside the block

# Part 3: Smart Contract Features and World View

# You are developing for a distribute system!

This means:
- No privacy
..
..

# Smart Contracts have TWO forms of memory

constract Storage {
  unit256 st = 1 // Storage

  {
      // memory
  }
}

# contract env variables

blocks:
gas limit, network difficulty, Previouse hashes, miner's address

tx.origin() -> don't use it
don't sue tx.sender, use msg.sender. tx.sender can lead to man in the middle attack

# Contracts are blind and can't see the outside world

# Oracle contracts

BBC News -> Footbal results -> Oracle

Did Newcastle beat Sutherland -> Oracle replies 'yes, 3:0'

# Solidity Not turing-complete .. But that doesn't matter anyway

Solidity (and the EVM) has computation boudner by the gas limit

Today: a block gas limit is 8 milion gas

# Be careful not to run out of gas .. might lock your coins

You can copy any contract on ethscan

# TIPS

Everything is public
And replicated across the entire peer to peer network!

Event driven
Contacts don't do anything by themselfs. It must be notifed by a transaction (and someone has to pay for that)

Adversaries everywhere

# Part 4: State Channels

Everything on the nerowk is expensie. Can we deploy something in a way that it is being run only between a group on their machines and run on their machines.

# Cryptocurrencie don not scale

What is the problem?

Decantralisation and Public Verifiability

# Ok. How do we scale?

Centralised - don't
Twear Consesus Protocl - other cryptocurrencies
  Increase Block Size;
Sharding
Off chain
  Sidechain
  Local consensus (channel)

# What is a "channel"?

Every party collectively authorises a new state on an application locally amongst themselves

The blockchain acts as a root of trust to gurantee safety

Essentially, each party is refunded the coins they desecre is one pary does not co-operate
  then you deply to main chain and finish

# Two smart contracts

Application (battleship) contract
Lets players play the battelship game vie the blockcain

.....

# Application (Battelship) Contract

Function lock()
  When approved by all parties, lock all functionality within the app and laucn he sate channel

# Lifecycle

Everyone signs the lock contract

# always online assumption

all parties must reman online to detect and defend exections fortks

alice

block 1 = init dispute
block 2 = update state
block 3 = null
block 4 = updae state

# can we help alleviae new security channel?

Pisa: Hire an accountable third party to help when bob is offline and Alice cheats

State privacy: Custodian should not learn about the state he is watching

# Application-Agnostic State Channel

# What applications make sense?

All parties remain online throughput the application life-time
A small group of parties (due to lack of fault tolerance)
All parties want to execute the application more than one time
Examples: Payment, casino games, boardroom voting, actions etc.

# IPFS - inter planetary file system

put your data there, store link in your contract
when you submit a file to IPFS it takes hash of the file to make a link

every file can be found by human readable names using IPNS

IT IS ATM unlimited free storage
